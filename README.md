# Minimal POC for describing buildings using custom HTML entities (Tags)
Developed based on conversations with [JosepMariaPujol] (https://github.com/JosepMariaPujol/HTML-Build)
for his super awesome thesis project.

The idea is to use custom HTML entities to represent building entities with minmal CSS to define layers of attributes and properties.

Design principles / assumptions are.

1. Follow IFC as much as possible
2. Use HTML5 principles to solve all problems
3. Make it super easy to hack
4. Have fun

This repo contains a minimal example with the basic CSS file. Other examples will be added soon.
