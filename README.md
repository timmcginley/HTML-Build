# Minimal POC for describing buildings using custom HTML entities (Tags)
Developed based on conversations with [JosepMariaPujol](https://github.com/JosepMariaPujol/HTML-Build)
for his super awesome thesis project.

The idea is to use custom HTML entities to represent (ifc) building entities with minmal CSS to define layers of attributes and properties.

Design principles / assumptions are.

1. Use HTML5 principles to solve all problems
2. Follow IFC / standards as much as possible
3. Super easy and fun for humans to hack
4. Provide a common file format across softwares / systems

This repo contains a minimal example with the basic CSS file. Other examples will be added soon.
